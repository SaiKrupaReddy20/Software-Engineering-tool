Plugin for github for better user interaction.
Github is a large open-source platform with million of projects. Generally it is difficult for a user to explore in his interested areas.
So,if we can suggest some repositories based on his interests, then github becomes more user friendly. Also, if we get through one 
repository and finds it interesting, it is difficult to find similar repositories. In todayâ€™s world, we find many repositories to be 
similar. Ranking the similar repositories helps the users to choose better repositories.
